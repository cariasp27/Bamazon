# Bamazon Overview
Bamazon is a storefront application utilizing Node.js and MySQL. Users will be displayed the inventory and asked what they would like to buy and the amount of that product. If there is sufficient inventory of that product, then the purchase will go through, if not, the user will be sent back to the inventory list.

## Setup
This application requires some setup before operation. You will need to have Node.js installed on your computer as well as some type of Command Line Interface (CLI). Once you have Node and a CLI, navigate to the root folder of your application in the CLI and run npm i. This will install the neccesary packages, MySQL and Inquirer, found in the package.json file. Once completed, you are all geared up and ready to use the Bamazon App!
